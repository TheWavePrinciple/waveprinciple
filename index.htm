<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I'm Paul Sutherland, I became top 1% most watched trader at the world&rsquo;s biggest trade forum while developing the Seventh Wave Principle. I realized how to catch every swing in the markets finding every move every hour every day for months at a time. This shocked the online trading community and earned me cult status as a master trader.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I broke all the rules of what people thought possible in forecasting and documented it all at the forum for 8 years. I've been studying charts for ten years isolating wave groups, plotting sequences and realized I had discovered my own version of 'The Wave Principle,' from the ground up, and now I'm proud to present it to you.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">I'm going to teach you my cutting edge techniques and give you the benefit of 10 years of research and the revelations. I hope you'll love the Seventh Wave principle as much as I do. I hope you add these invaluable lessons to your trading arsenal.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seventh Wave Principle will provide you with many profitable opportunities for the future. Paul Sutherland (Suthmo)</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Seventh Wave Principle fully illustrates the fractal pattern that forms the markets cycle. You'll see how waves link together in sequence through a matrix of sevens.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Do you want to become a consistently successful trader? Look no further as wave principle is the only game in town. With Seventh Wave Principle you can grow your understanding of recent price movements as they apply to larger market trends.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other market tools fail often. Tools such as market oscillators and moving averages are lagging indicators, they have their strong points but overall they fail to alert traders to the full picture. These indicators are not as useful in identifying price targets as well as the Wave Principle.</span></p>

"9 above&nbsp;14&nbsp;below." Each set of 7 is divided into 3 degrees. A matrix of light consciousness dancing across the flower of life condensing into lower grosser forms of matter. Governed by Fibonacci sequence the matrix flows through the infinitely repeating palindrome toroidal sequence of overlapped interlocked series of sevens from which the platonic solid shapes emerge from the arrangement of sub circuits, relative to the Fibonacci sequence. I know how and why platonic solids emerge from pure energy now. The &lsquo;Sutherland Wave Principle&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Seventh Wave Principle&rsquo; is a blueprint of a fixed set of laws that comprises the coaxial circuits that time and space are contained by. Seventh Wave Principle defines a natural field, a container of energy, like a cup or a grail container of light source. This arrangement of time/energy circuits produce the vedic staircase from which all number systems emerge. This arrangement produces the tetrahedron. All known harmonics are relative to a central line of the tetrahedron. The all emerges from these arrangements emerging from the 7 circle flower of life creation pattern producing the circuits of space/time. Sutherland Wave Principle Lesson 1:... Platonic Solids. This lesson explains how the flower of life's ratcheting vortex motion arrangement of spheres produces all the platonic solid shapes. The article goes on to discuss the various properties of each circle added to the flower of life to form a Vessica Pisces. We learn how the flower of life's story is also the story of human reproduction with egg formation. This story explains how each circle added to the flower of life produces successive platonic solid shapes as they progress. We learn how seven represents a return to source. I explain how I've realized how waves grow in octaves as they go up and down in scale. Concepts of a waveform universe explains how the flower of life creates all geometry we see in 3D.

This lesson chronicles my journey to discovery of how quantum physics relates to wave principle and how the two subjects have become one. This video describes how I became frustrated in my search and through observing a Nassim Haramein post about the flower of life geometry led me to research and discover and learn deeply about quantum physics by finding the website cosmic-core.org by Author Renee Hoadley. The lesson goes onto discuss my efforts to model time leading to my discovery that Tesla's 3, 6, 9 code is embedded in waves in space and time. This is where the world of sacred geometry and sacred numbers opened up to me and collided with my own work. Reading from cosmic-core.org I learned of the flower of life pattern geometry underpins all reality. This lesson explains how the seven circles of the Seed of Life genesis pattern is a web that underlies all reality first mentioned in the Emerald Tablets of Toth.

This lesson briefly describes how Wave Principle was first discovered by Ralph Nelson Elliott in 1938 but in 2018 was re realized, transformed from 5 to a 7 wave system and merged with quantum physics in 2021. The wave principle has been re realized independently, the entire market cycle de-coded piece by piece over a decade of research, observation and isolation. What emerged seems to be an infinitely repeating, overlapped, interlocking series of sevens. The &lsquo;Sutherland Wave Principle&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Seventh Wave Principle&rsquo; is a blueprint of a fixed set of laws that comprises the field that waves are contained by. Seventh Wave Principle defines a natural field, a container of energy, like a cup or a grail. R.N Elliott and I both agree that contrary to popular belief the news is ancillary to the Wave Principle, I.e. nothing outside seems to be affecting day to day prices. Elliott states the market has a law of its own, not propelled by linear forces. Elliott believed that the market was ruled by advancing waves of five corrected by a retracement of three waves, the 5:3 pattern relationships. I'm going to demonstrate how every single wave is made of seven sub divisions and is in fact ruled by an infinitely repeating 7 x 7 relationship. Elliott states categorically that the market is not a cyclic rhythmic machine, but its movement represents structured formal progression.</span></span></h3>

<h2 class="ck ck-title">What It Took To Learn Markets And Discover<br /><br />Sutherland's Quantum Wave Principle<br /><br />There's 1000s of systems out there but every now and then someone comes along with real magic.<br />&nbsp;</h2>
They showed me that the past repeats in the future upside down and back to front, there's a copy of today on the other side of reality out there in the future, someone showed me how to catch it. The projects go back to approx 1995 paper study,&nbsp;further study began in 2005 and a major study began in 2010. I re wrote 'The Wave Principle' in 2018. I merged wave principle with quantum physics in 2020.
<h1><br />How This Happened?</h1>
<p>I had read the Emerald Tablets, they're quite cryptic. I didn't realize at the time but it was pointed out later they are describing reality and the planes of matter as a 7 layer matrix. Maybe something from the tablets came through my research.</p>
<p><br />Major study begins 2010<br /><br /><strong>2 Years&nbsp;Sequencing Charts</strong></p>
<p>Two years plotting where and how the past and future meet within waves.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;isolated 'The Primary Sequence.'</p>
<p><br /><strong>2 Years of Isolating Wave Groups</strong></p>
<p>Isolating different sections of a price chart and trying to identify different looking sections of waves and grouping them. Matching the results with other charts and realizing all the charts isolated groups have something in common.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2 Years decoding 7</strong><br />Realizing and detailing the separate sections of a complete run of 7 waves.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3 Years Realizing there's something called Elliot Wave principle</strong></p>
<p>I found Elliott Wave Principle and studied it, comparing it to the 7x7 matrix then completely re working all of EWP to reflect the 7x7 field matrix. Working out new Fibonacci&nbsp;laws.</p>
<h1><strong>2 Years The Study of Quantum Physics at The Free Library</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Quantum Wave Principle is born</strong></p>
<h1>Realizing this 7x7 system + Wave Principle =&nbsp;<strong>Quantum Wave Principle</strong>&nbsp;Drawing new model in quantum physics and using it to verify the relationship between wave principle and quantum physics. Discovering waves form in groups of 7 divided by 3 time frames. Writing the story of how quantum physics is the bedrock of wave principle.</h1>
<h1><strong>1 Year</strong><br />Bringing everything together. Going back to the beginning of my research and pulling in some elements that had been over shadowed while working on new discoveries.<br />&nbsp;</h1>
<p>The project has come full circle.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what it took to learn the market I know.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2013&nbsp;</strong>last week I called every top and bottom from Friday 26th to Friday the 3rd May 7 days 940 pips starting at $100 at a $ a pip and going up a $ at every turn would be &pound;3500&nbsp;<strong>3500% increase in 7 days in 7 trades. It seems it took Gann the whole of 1933 and 477 trades to go 4000%</strong>&nbsp;I wasn't live trading this but have banked %680 in 2 day live trading. This is what I do. I think I was demo trading at this time.</p>
<p><strong>April and May 2016</strong>I got 2 days wrong out of the two months of back to back daily swing calls. I banked +2000 pips in two months +7900% my highest return.</p>
<p>All these calls where posted in real time with hundreds of traders at Forex Factory website. If you go to my&nbsp;suthmo profile there and plug in any of the above statements you can see all these calls as they happened in real time as of today 12/09/22 6666 forecast posts and comments on Sutherland Wave Principle and trading in general. if you got trading questions, plug them into my bio at the factory you might come up with some gold.</p>

<p>17/05/2010 Name in Xxxxxxx</p>
<p>I am so impressed with your system it's so accurate. I am an MT4 coder, can your system be mechanical? It would be the greatest .mql ever. Do you want it to become an expert Advisor? With so much accuracy are you already a millionaire? If you want to code it, I am here to help. I am very surprised at the accuracy of your analysis but a little skeptical. I don't believe in indicators in this market. So far I have not seen any system that is automatically profitable. What is your analysis next week? You are the master. I am impressed with your accuracy, even the time! Your system is great accuracy, over 60%!! You are the best... Guys come to me and tell me that they have a great system. We could become so rich. I code... but in longer time they are not profitable. I tell them.. if you want me to code for you... first you must be profitable for six months. But your system... I am impressed with the time accuracy!</p>
<p>/////////////</p>
<p>hi man, please help me, I saw you are very good on your analysis.</p>
<p>i have a short at 2420, SL 2600(missed it, back down now) should I hold it ? can u give me an idea where this thing is heading to based on your analysis ,please !</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>Hi mate.</p>
<p>I've seen you have a very accurate system that predicts even interventions and strange things...</p>
<p>Could you tell me more about it?</p>
<p>How can I test it or see how it works by myself?</p>
<p>/////////////////////</p>
<p>Default hi</p>
<p>can you show me how you did your analysis.......I would like to learn something new.....I am sure I can show you tricks of my own.....</p>

<p>Hi suthmo,</p>
<p>I have been reading your posts and I&acute;m very impressed.Congratulations, sometime ago there was a member called xxxx who made some pretty good calls based on time/price relation and I got hooked by the idea. Would you like to share some source of information about it? I&acute;m not asking for the product of your education, I want to research myself, but unfortunately till date I haven&acute;t found valuable info about it.</p>
<p>Nice trading week for you mate.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>///////////////</p>
<p>Default hi</p>
<p>hi suthmo...may i ask you something ?</p>
<p>could i follow your trade ? seems you're good with this...even not the whole thing was right but 70% accurate</p>
<p>so...i was curious about taking a long position since this morning...and what do you think if i enter long now ? is it possible for drop to 2210-20 again ?</p>
<p>thx.</p>
<p>//////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>Hi suthmo,just like to say that was a</p>
<p>pretty good call you made on the dow</p>

<p>Take care</p>
<p>XXXXXXXX</p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am a new trader from XXXXX. I am trying to make a living with forex. Can you please let me know where i can learn about your strategy? I have seen your posts for a while and they really work.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help before hand (sorry my English as it is not my native language).</p>
